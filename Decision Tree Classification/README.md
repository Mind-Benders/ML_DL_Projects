# Problem Statement 1

Build the model to classify the flower classes i.e. serosa, virginica and versicolor based on their features.

Given Features: Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal length, and Petal width (all measured in cm).

### Dataset

The dataset for this project is taken from the Kaggle. 

Here is the link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset that was used.

### What Have I Done?

- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Described the data
- Visualized the patterns based on the features
- Splitted the data into training and testing data
- Built the Decision Tree Classifier model
- Trained the model with training data
- Evaluated the model using testing data
- Checked the Confusion matrix and Accuracy 

### Libraries Used:

- Pandas
- Plotly
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Some Visualizations

## Conclusion

Here, Accuracy score of the model is 1.0(ideal). ;)

It is because the rows are very low as well as the data is pretty straight-forward, so it is cakewalk for the decision tree classifier


# Problem Statement 2

Build the model to predict whether the person has a heart disease or not based on given parameters.

Given Features: age, sex, chest pain type (4 values), resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2), 
maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, 
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy, thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

## Conclusion

We got the Accuracy score of 0.9853658536585366. 
By observing above results, we can conclude that Decision Tree classifies the classes correctly(mostly).


# Problem Statement 3

Predict whether the smoke/fire is detected or not using given parameters.

Given Features: UTC, Temperature[C], Humidity[%], TVOC[ppb], eCO2[ppm], Raw H2, Raw Ethanol, Pressure[hPa], PM1.0, PM2.5, NC0.5, NC1.0, NC2.5, CNT.
